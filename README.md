### Question:
- [Which is the mostly used configuration management tool?](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/v6qowh/which_is_the_mostly_used_configuration_management/)

quote:
>This is where I preach the gospel of Packer + Ansible + Terraform. Packer packages machine images. It has an Ansible provisioner, so you can use Ansible to configure the VM, and then packer will package it into a “golden image”. Then use Terraform to deploy said golden image.

>Honestly it seems like config management is setting with the sun though. With so many serverless services (or kubernetes), the most config management needed is maybe a Dockerfile to build container images.
